## Details

In this section, you will find examples demonstrating different aspects of our project's functionality.

- [Segmented Search](search.md): Learn how to perform segmented search using a multi task definition using function calling 

- [One shot Query Planning](planning-tasks.md): Explore how to plan and decompose a complex query into multiple subqueries in a single request.

- [Recursive Schemas](recursive.md): Understand how to work with recursive schemas, and also why flat is better than nested.

- [Exact Citations](exact_citations.md): Find out how to generate exact citations by using smart prompting and regular expressions

- [Automated Dataframe Extraction](autodataframe.md): Discover how to automate dataframe extraction to not only return a table, but possibly multiple tables.

- [Creating Multiple File Programs](gpt-engineer.md): Master how to create multiple file programs based on specification using function calling.

Feel free to explore these examples to gain a better understanding of various patterns on how creative prompting, description, and structuring of `OpenAISchema` and unlock new capabilities.
